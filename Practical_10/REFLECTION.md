# I.ESTIMATES TIME FOR EACH PRACTICAL TASKS:
## 1. Testing.py: Est: 15 mins  - Real: 1 hour
## 2. Wiki.py: Est: 15 mins - Real: 30 mins
## 3. Flask project - Est 45 mins - Real: 15 mins
## 4. Flask demo - Est 50 mins - Real: 1h 30 mins

### The accuracy for the time estimate is not increasing so much. Because in each practicals we are touching a new knowledge point. So we don't have any experience of the topic before. That's why the estimate of time is not accurate.

# II. CODE REVIEWS:
## -From the code review, i realize that many times other student really help me to fix important error, some have added the detail that i forgot about the requirement, which really save my work. The peer review is very important as our thoughts are never perfect and there is always room for improvement.
## -From review the other code, i can learn on their faults, and try to avoid it in my code. Also, i can learn on their way of doing the task, their comment style, which are very useful.

# III. PRACTICAL TASKS:
## - I think the task is great, and the diversity of the task is nice. But, for the practical 10, which is only an addition, i think it should have more works as Flask is a very good part for future works.
